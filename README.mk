TRACMASS makes it possible to estimate water paths, Lagrangian stream functions (barotropic and overturning), exchange times, particle sedimentation, etc.

TRACMASS has been used in studies of the global ocean circulation, of sea circulation in The Baltic, The Mediterranean, and in coastal regions.

The code is written in FORTRAN 95 with modules and runs on UNIX platforms such as MAC OS X and Linux.

TRACMASS has been set up to run with velocities integrated with models such as NEMO, ORCA, ROMS, POM, MICOM, IFS-ECMWF and EC-Earth.
